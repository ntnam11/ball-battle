## Scripts structure
- [ARManager.cs](Assets/Scripts/ARManager.cs): All AR-related functions

- [GameManager.cs](Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs): The main Game Manager, in charge for handling most game logics
- [GameUICtrl.cs](Assets/Scripts/GameUICtrl.cs): Game UI controller, this and GameManager works together, one for game logics, one for sending those logics to UI
- [Globals.cs](Assets/Scripts/Globals.cs): ScriptableObject used to store global variables that need to be consistence between scenes
- [MainMenu.cs](Assets/Scripts/MainMenu.cs): handle what appears on the main menu

- [Params.cs](Assets/Scripts/Params.cs): Parameters to balance the game
- [PenaltyCtrl.cs](Assets/Scripts/PenaltyCtrl.cs): For Penalty scene

## Random thoughts

### How do I feel about this project
This is the first time I've made an AR-ready project. Some AR challenges include:
- Implement AR core elements
- Positioning, transforming & scaling objects
- Make sure everything is consistent between AR-ready and non-AR gameplay
- ...

### Estimated time for each section
Total: approx. 7 days, including
- Core gameplay: approx. 2 days
- UI: approx. 1 day
- AR: approx. 2+ days
- Building, Testing, etc: approx. 2 days

Of course I don't do those separately. i.e I tweak UI while waiting for AR file to be built. Why? Read the next part pls

### The most challenging problem
I don't have an Android phone (luckily my iPhone supports AR). Unity Editor & Unity Remote doesn't support debugging with AR enabled. Android Studio does (with Virtual camera enabled for Android Virtual Device - or AVD), but the Emulator itself doesn't work with Unity APK builds (AR supports x86 emulators, while Unity runs with arm64 ._.). I tried Nox, but it doesn't work either.

In the end, I had to change the platform of this project to iOS, export xCode project, use a VM to build it and install to my phone.
I also used [Runtime Inspector & Hierachy](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityRuntimeInspector) to *debug* AR and write some codes to *print to screen*.
The whole process (from exporting to installing) costs ~ 15 mins total (u can say it's a huge pain everytime trying to modify something in the code and wait for its result). To save time while waiting for the VM to build, I modify UI, Gameplay, etc.

### What could be improved
- Better UI (I'm not good at designing tho)
- Some extensive AR functions. i.e. using two fingers to scale the field, swipe to rotate it, etc.
- Better character animation
- Code cleaning & optimizing
